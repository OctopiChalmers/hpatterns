{- | Builds an HExp representation of a basic case-expression.

For example, the following can be (sort of?) represented:

> case e of
>   Pos x -> x + 1
>   Neg x -> x

The conditions for taking the Pos/Neg branch is given by the toHExp class
method though, so really, it's more like this:

> case e of
>   x | x > 0 -> x + 1
>   x | 0 > x -> x

__Type safety:__

* Assumes that the number of functions provided is the same number as
the number of constructors for the 'Partable' type. Probably does something
weird if this is not the case.

* There is no way to explicitly specify which function to apply for which
case. Instead, the order used for the 'Partable' constructors is the one
given by deriving 'Enum'. The first function given to 'case1' is applied
to the first constructor, and so on.

For example, if we have the following definition for 'PatSign':

> data Num a => PatSign a = Pos | Neg
>     deriving (Bounded, Enum, Show)

and the expression

> case1 e [f1, f2]

where @e@ is a 'PatSign' type, @f1@ would be applied to the Pos
case, and @f2@ to the Neg case.
